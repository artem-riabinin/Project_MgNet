# Implementation of Multigrid and MgNet

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing the Multigrid method and MgNet for solving linear systems and image classification. The assignment is divided into two main tasks:
1. **Multigrid Method**: Solve a given linear system using both the gradient descent method and the multigrid method, compare their performance, and analyze the error convergence.
2. **MgNet Implementation**: Modify the Multigrid implementation to implement MgNet and apply it to the CIFAR-10 dataset to achieve high test accuracy under parameter constraints.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.
